# iOD
iOD is a small utility dictionary. It uses an Open Dictionary API ([Dicionário Aberto]) hence the name iOD.

# Purpose
This app is not intended to be used on your daily basis because the API that feeds it only contains entries from a 1913 dictionary, which is currently in public domain. I've just developed this to start macOS development and improve my Swift skills.

# Usage
Just clone or download the ZIP of this repo and run on your Xcode. You should use at least version 8 of the Xcode and Swift 3.
